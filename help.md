We understand that sometimes you have different questions and want to post on Piazza. Our staff are trying our best to answer questions as soon/much as we can. There are some tips for you to receive more efficient help(also good for future coding courses):
1. Please **search Piazza** to see if your question has already been answered before posting a question.
2. General questions or concepts are **always** good to ask on Piazza
3. Some logistic/special/unexpected issues are **always** good to ask on Piazza
4. Debugging / Issues are good to ask on Piazza, but for this type of question, please consider to **improve the readability** of your questions:

   1. Focus more on **logic** than code itself, try to ask more like "how should I code this logic of ...", or "I am thinking of ..., it didn't work...". We intend to provide you the ideas/hints to guide you through the learning but not just throw the standard solution on you.

   2. If you are experiencing an issue/error, posting **only** a code screenshot on Piazza is **NOT** recommended. 
 
       > **Here's a possible funny scene:** tutors saw a huge image of colorful Java codes, and we need to find the issue by staring at this image and come up with the solution by our reasoning and imagination when we cannot access any output or any other parts of your code. :crying_cat_face: Then, we might provide a possible solution to you, but your code still has bugs. You will reply, we will try again, and repeat. You feel sad, we feel sad, everyone is sad. :disappointed_relieved:

       So, if you are doing a post like this, try to make us more familiar with your code.

       As always, tutor hours are better places. :yum: You can do posts if you cannot access tutor hours at some time, we will try to help but you should expect Piazza help on debugging will be less accurate and less timely in some way.

5. Don't expect Piazza, any tutor hours, or any office hours to be a place for you to **"verify" the correctness of your work**, we help to guide you through or correct your problems. The **verification** will not happen in any other non-cs courses, so we try to do the same.

6. Use tutor hours and office hours **wisely**. Our team is always trying to balance the distribution of hours according to the deadline and release day. However, we do need to accommodate our schedules. You need to expect the queue will be long on Wednesday and Thursday, so take advantage of any hours distributed in free time windows or free days.

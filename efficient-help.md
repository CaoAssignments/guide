This course has a variety of resources available to you. We understand that sometimes you have different questions and want to post on Piazza. Our staff are trying our best to answer questions as soon/much as we can. There are some tips for you to receive more efficient help (also good for future coding courses):

1. Please search Piazza to see if your question has already been answered before posting a question.
2. General questions or concepts are always good to ask on Piazza.
3. Some logistic/special/unexpected issues are always good to ask on Piazza.
4. If you have extenuating circumstances and would request a one-time extension, please email Paul directly at yic242@ucsd.edu. Do not post them on Piazza.
5. We do NOT debug code or Gradescope output via Piazza. Questions such as “I am failing this test case and here is a screenshot of my code” will be ignored. These questions are best for tutor hours.
6. You can, however, send in private questions if there is an error in the autograder on Gradescope. An error has occurred <b>if and only if</b> you receive the following message: ![image](https://github.com/CaoAssignments/guides/assets/47510212/741a7160-824e-43e8-baa7-d742380060d8)
7. Don’t expect Piazza, any tutor hours, or any office hours to be a place for you to “verify” the correctness of your work, we help to guide you through or correct your problems. The verification will not happen in any other non-cs courses, so we try to do the same.
8. Use tutor hours and office hours wisely. Our team is always trying to balance the distribution of hours according to the deadline and release day. However, we do need to accommodate our schedules. You need to expect the queue will be long on Wednesdays and Thursdays, so take advantage of any hours distributed in free time windows or free days.

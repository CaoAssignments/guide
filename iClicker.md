UCSD has migrated to iClicker Cloud from iClicker classic in Winter 2024, so registering your iClicker may be slightly different than past quarters. **Note: We will start grading participation week 2.**

1) Go to https://www.iclicker.com/. If you already have an account, go to step 4. If not, continue to step 2.

2) Create a student account and search for University of California San Diego.

3) Register for an account using your **UCSD email**. Be sure to also add your PID to the Student ID section so that we can confirm that it is you.

4) Log in as a student. If this is a new account, it will ask you to register your remote. Register your remote with the remote ID on the back of the remote.

5) Click the "+" sign in the top right to add a class.

6) Select University of California San Diego and search for 12-WI25. Select CSE12 taught by Paul Cao. Click "Add This Course" and you should see 12-WI25 in your Courses page. At this point, your iClicker remote should be registered and linked to you for when we port participation grades.
